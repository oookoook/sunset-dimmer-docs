Sunset Dimmer **saves your eyes** when working on a computer **at night**.

The app automatically **changes the brightness** of your displays at **sunset and sunrise** to match the environment's light conditions. 

Sunset Dimmer integrates seamlessly with Windows **Night Light** so you can help your eyes as much as possible:

- Night Light reduces the blue light emitted by your display, 
- Sunset Dimmer **reduces the brightness** difference between your displays and ambient light sources. 

Your eyes will **not be stressed and strained** anymore.
