Windows 10 and 11 offer a great feature that helps your eyes called **[Night light](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136)**. The Night light reduces the amount of **blue light** emitted by the displays. However, this feature has a significant drawback: it does not change display brightness. 

In many environments, you need **bright displays** during the day. But dimming the display for the night is too cumbersome using the display controls or external apps. You have to **adjust the settings two times each day**.

The **Sunset Dimmer** takes this responsibility from you. Set up the desired brightness levels once, and the app will take care of the rest. 

The Sunset Dimmer connects to the Night Light Windows feature and listens for the Night Light state change. This way, it **automatically dims** your displays when sunset comes and **increases** the brightness when you start working in the morning.

Sunset Dimmer ensures that your eyes have **optimal conditions** to perform. You automatically watch a nice **bright screen during the day** to combat sunlight and **dimmed screen at night** to reduce eye strain.
