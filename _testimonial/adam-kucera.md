I am a software developer, often working during evenings and nights to meet deadlines or to get some calm hours when working from home. I developed this app primarily for myself and found it helpful, even more so after switching to a relatively large 32" screen. I decided to improve the app so it's easier to use and offered it publicly so others could benefit.
